# Budget Tracker

[link to deployed application](https://glacial-escarpment-70135.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
This app was used to demonstrate indexDB and the use of a service worker. With the indexDB the server will be fully functional offline. (other than posting transactions for others to see). With the use of the service worker we are able to "CACHE" information and certain files in order to allow the application to run much faster and smoother. One more feature that is highlighted in this application is the use of a manifest folder. Which allows users to download the application and use it personally from your computer or even from your phone!
